                            I'm a Baltimore guy, but I don't look like a typical Baltimore guy.

                            In my teenage years, I hung out with the anime crowd. I eventually fell into the cyber-goth groups. And then the actors and hipsters.

                            I've served this city since I was 17. Sometimes I was poorly serving mail around the city offices. Sometimes I served the city with education. And I last served the city standing against crime as a member of an aerial survailance program. I was resposible for closing several murder cases. I don't remember every victim. I remember the murderers. I remember the men I pursued. And the broken justice system that kept them free.

                            I hold every oppertunity lightly. I don't think it's possible to determine if I'll be
                             successful at this job or not. What I do know is if I have to leave I will miss what 
                             I got to be in this city. I've been a lot of things in this city. I've been hunted by gangs,
                              I've hunted gangs. I've been called racist slurs. I've been beaten. I've been in love. And 
                               I've accomplished a lot.

                            In 2003 I went on my first camping trip. In 2011 I drove to see my father for the first time and took my first trip to new york. In 2012 I read the Hobbit for the first time.
                            I'm used to adventures. The unknown is all I've ever known. In 2020 I worked alongside the homicide division. In 2021 I drove for Uber. I've been published, 
                            I've been on stage, I've been on film, I've taught in college, whther I fail or succeed, whatever comes I'll be ready. The unknown is all I've known.
